Rice U Bootcamp Module Assignment 18: Pizza Hunt

## Introduction

you’ll learn about NoSQL databases. NoSQL databases allow you to easily store and retrieve unstructured data, which can significantly improve performance for some applications—especially those that use a lot of data.

You’ll use MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, to store data using documents in the BSON format, which is a JSON-like object. MongoDB is part of the MERN stack (MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), so this module will bring you one step closer to creating applications using this popular tech stack.

You’ll also use Mongoose, an Object-Document Mapper (ODM), to map MongoDB’s document representations of data to a virtual object database. This uses an object-oriented approach, similar to the way an ORM maps relational representations of data to objects.

## Acceptance Criteria

Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL.

Configure Heroku for deployment of a Node.js application using MongoDB.

Explain and execute CRUD methods with MongoDB.

Integrate Mongoose in a full-stack web application.

Create query builders to populate documents using refs.
